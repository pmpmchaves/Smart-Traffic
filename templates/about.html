            <h2>Brief description</h2>

<p>Traffic congestion has become a major issue all around the world, thus policymakers and city managers have huge challenges to improve the quality of life in urban areas. It is a widely occurring traffic phenomenon in metropolitan areas due to the increasing number of road vehicle users and is characterized by slower vehiclesâ€™ speeds, longer travel times, queues and, sometimes, complete paralysis of the traffic network.

  Smart-Traffic is Mobility as a Service application for real-time traffic prediction.</p>
  
<p> This proof of concept relies on the work of Dr. Taiwo O. Adetiloye:
  
<p><b>Adetiloye</b>, Taiwo Olubunmi (2018), Predicting Short-Term Traffic Congestion on 
Urban Motorway Networks. Ph.D. thesis, 
<a href="https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/985249/" target= "blank">https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/985249/</a>, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada</p>
</p>

<p>The following three-steps are required for setup:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>1. Install Docker<br><br></li>

<li>2. Execute the following docker commands from the command line:</li>
  <p style="background-color: rgb(171, 179, 196); padding-left:10px; padding-top:10px ; padding-bottom:10px">
    docker pull taiwotman/smart-traffic:beta1.1 <br>

    docker run --rm -p  &lt;desired-port&gt;:5000   &lt;image-id&gt;
  </p> 
  <p>
    For example:
  </p> 
  <p style="background-color:rgb(171, 179, 196);padding-left:10px; padding-top:10px; padding-bottom:10px">
    docker pull taiwotman/smart-traffic:latest

    docker run --rm  -p  80:5000 taiwotman/smart-traffic:latest</p>
<li>3. On your browser, open: <a href="http://localhost:80" target="blank"> http://localhost:80</a></li>
</ul></p>
